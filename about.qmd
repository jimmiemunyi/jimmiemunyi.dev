I am a software engineer from Kenya. My major interests revolve around AI and deep learning. 

I code mostly in Python, but can *very hackily* use JavaScript too when need be. I am also learning Rust and adding it to my arsenal.

I currently work in the AI team at [Tambua Health](https://www.tambuahealth.com/).

## Notes

I heavily take notes whenever I can, these can be from podcasts, youtube videos I watch, talks I attend, online MOOCs etc. For taking notes, I use Obsidian + a private GitHub repo backup across my machines. I previously used Notion which I would recommend too

I share some of them here on my website, mostly so that I can have a central place where I can scheme through them from time to time. You can find the public ones here: <a href="notes.qmd">notes</a>

## Today I Learned

I keep a record of things I learned throughout my day. Check them out here: <a href="til.qmd">TIL</a>

## Music

I love listening to music. I always have my headphones on me everywhere I go.

I enjoy chill and underground rap and hip-hop music mostly. I also enjoy alternative music, my favorite bands being The 1975 and twenty one pilots.
Generally, I listen to any good music that gets my body moving, across all genres.

You can connect with me on Spotify (I don't use it that often these days) and on Apple Music, both @jimmiemunyi and get to listen to my playlists and share yours.

## Meditation

Meditation is a good way to practice staying in the moment and has it's benefit in our day to day lives. I practive <a href="https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index">Vipassana Meditaion</a>.

My friends often tell me that they too have their own practices that keep them in touch with themselves: be it exercising, the gym, praying to some deity, others love taking walks etc. 

I think everyone should have their preferred way of keeping sane and keeping in touch with themselves, as long as its:

- universal. Can be practiced with anyone from any background. (religion, race, financial status, etc.)
- involves no dogma.
- simple to understand. Doesn't have strange practices that you 'should just believe in'.
