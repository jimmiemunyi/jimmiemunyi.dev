I am a software engineer from Kenya. My major interests revolve around AI and deep learning. 

I code mostly in Python, but can *very hackily* use JavaScript too when need be. I am also learning Rust and adding it to my arsenal.

I currently work in the AI team at [Tambua Health](https://www.tambuahealth.com/).

You can contact me on social media with the links provided above or email me at my <a href="mailto:jimmiemunyi@gmail.com">personal email</a>

I am most likely to respond on Twitter, either DM or @ me on a tweet.

## books

I try to keep a list of books I have read and their reviews on my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106271494-jimmie-munyi">goodreads profile</a>. Both fiction and non-fiction. 

Here is a non-exhaustive list of books that I have read that have been the most memorable for me:

- Introduction to Psychology - James Kalat
- The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark.
- Surely you are joking, Mr. Feynman!
- Thinking, Fast and Slow.
- Deep Learning for Coders.
- Neural Networks from Scratch - <a href="https://nnfs.io/">link</a>

## notes

I heavily take notes whenever I can, these can be from podcasts, youtube videos I watch, talks I attend, online MOOCs etc. For taking notes, I use Obsidian + a private GitHub repo backup across my machines. I previously used Notion which I would recommend too

I share some of them here on my website, mostly so that I can have a central place where I can scheme through them from time to time. You can find the public ones here: <a href="notes.qmd">notes</a>

## music

I love listening to music. I always have my headphones on me everywhere I go.

I enjoy chill and underground rap and hip-hop music mostly, but I listen to any good music that gets my head bopping, across all genres.

You can connect with me on Spotify (I don't use it that often these days) and on Apple Music, both @jimmiemunyi and get to listen to my playlists and share yours (please!)

## meditation

I practive <a href="https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index">Vipassana Meditaion</a>. It keeps me in touch with myself. My friends tell me that they too have practices that keep them in touch with themselves: for some its exercising and the gym, others pray to some deity, others love taking walks etc. I think everyone should have their way of keeping sane and keeping in touch with themselves, as long as its:

- universal. Can be practiced with anyone from any background.
- involves no dogma.
- simple to understand. Doesn't have strange practices that you 'should just believe in'.

Vipassana ticks all the above boxes for me and hence I practice it. I have also experienced positive results from it. But I do not claim this to be the only way. To each his own.
