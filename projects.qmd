These are some of my public projects that I worked on in my learning journey.


## 2023

### <a href="https://github.com/jimmiemunyi/snake-species-identification" target="_blank">Snake Species Identification</a> (Ongoing)


**Objective**: To determine the species a snake belongs to.

**Levers**: Use Image classification to identify the genus and species (binomial) and 
then use other factors like country/continent where a snake is most likely to be found.

**Data**: AI Crowd Species 2021 Identification Project. Can be found <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/snakeclef2021-snake-species-identification-challenge" target="_blank">here</a>

**Demo**: <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Jimmie/snake-species-identification" target="_blank">Snake Species Identification</a>


**Notes**: This was my first large project where I was working with a lot of data and had to predict a significant amount of categories
(386,006 photographs of 772 snake species). I learned how to scale down the data to a manageable size in the protoyping phase so as to
increase the speed of trying out new ideas and then gradually implement the ideas that worked on bigger and bigger scales of the data.
I also had first hand experience with techniques like MixUp, Progressize Resizing, and Self-Supervised learning when working on this project.

## 2021

### <a href="https://github.com/jimmiemunyi/similar-books" target="_blank">Book Recommendation System</a>

**Objective**: To recommend books to a user based on the books they have read.

**Levers**: Use Collaborative Filtering to recommend books to a user based on the books they have read. Link the
recommended books to Goodreads to get more information about the books.

**Data**: Goodreads Books 10k Dataset. Can be found <a href="https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k" target="_blank">here</a>

**Demo**: <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Jimmie/similar-books" target="_blank">Similar Books</a>

**Notes**: This was my first project where I used a dataset that was not in the form of images. I learned how to use
collaborative filtering as a recommender engine. I also learned about what embeddings are and how they are used in the
deep learning universe (spoiler alert: they are numbers! Meaningful numbers).

### <a href="https://github.com/jimmiemunyi/Sign-Language-App" target="_blank">American Sign Language Project</a>

**Objective**: To build an app that can translate American Sign Language alphabet to English alphabet.

**Levers**: Use opencv to process the video feed from the webcam and then use a CNN to classify the sign language alphabet.

**Data**: American Sign Language Dataset. Can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet" target="_blank">here</a>

**Demo**: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nggi8EwfOA" target="_blank">Demo on YouTube</a>

**Notes**: In this particular project, my main aim was the inference part of the model, i.e. how to make the model useful in the real world.
That's why I went the webcam video way, because this way, the sign language alphabet can be translated in real time. Training the model was 
routine image classifcation training. I also learned how to use opencv to process video feeds from the webcam. And how to process the video
frame by frame. I had to come up with a unique way to make the predictions consistent, since they could change from frame to frame, leading
to flickering predictions. Using the `queue` data structure was the solution to this problem.
