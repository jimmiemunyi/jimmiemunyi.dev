- Love can be instant. Think 'Love at first sight'. Attachment in what takes time.
- Our human brains are not meant to deal with more than 5 to 9 options. Limit your options if you want to be serious about someone.
- Do not binge. Think 'Tinder Culture'. This is harmful if you want to settle down or fall in love.
- When wanting to fall in love, focus on the positive illusions - reasons to say yes. We mostly fixate on the reasons to say no.
- Love and cheating are due to two different brain regions. (Not an excuse to cheat, maybe just an explanation?)
- Saying: Play with somebody, stay with somebody. Find ways to play with your partner, to grow the love between you.
