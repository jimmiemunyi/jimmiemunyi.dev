- Main concern is examining Language Models generative capabilities; and more specifically, their capabilities on collaborative writing with human authors.
- Both creative and argumentative writing.
- Some questions:
	- Can GPT-3 contribute new ideas, or does it merely expand on existing ones?
	- Does this ideation capability differ in the context of fiction vs persuasive arguments?
	- To what extent does this capability fluctuate when it is decoding parameters change?
- Tests both:
	- Language capabilities - fluent text
	- Collaboration capabilities - working jointly with authors
- Also shows need of curating large interaction datasets:
	- covers diverse contexts
	- support subjective interpretations
	- capture the process, not just the result
	- allow for possible reuse and expansions.
