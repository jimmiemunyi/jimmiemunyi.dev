## Problems
- We cannot measure the things that matter the most
- Metrics, can and will, be gamed
- Metrics overemphasize short-term concerns
- Many metrics gather data of what we do in highly addictive environments

## Framework for a healthier use of metrics
- Using a slate of metrics to get a fuller picture.
- Combine with qualitative accounts
- Involve a range of stakeholders, including those who will be most impacted
