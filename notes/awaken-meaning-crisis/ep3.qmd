- Break out of illusion and self-deception.
- Definition of myth – symbolic stories (perennial patterns) from implicit learning in a shareable format.
- Continuous cosmos – deep connection with the cosmos. Cycle.
- Great disembodying in the Axial age.
- Everyday world – out of touch with reality. Common world.
- Real world – trained mind sees this world. Reduced suffering / illusion
- Self transcendence / wisdom → leap from everyday world to the real world.
- Mindfulness revolution from India.
- Livable not believable.

## Ancient Israel
 - Concern is not what you say; how you think.
 - Grammar is how you put thoughts together.
 - Biblical grammar - still has influence to us to this day. We can not simply 'kill god'. 
 - Release from the cycle (continuous cosmos) – this is nirvana.
 - I am who I am. Meaning - I will be what I will be.
 - We should participate in shaping the future.
 - Turning points aka *Kairos*
 - *Da-ath* - You change it as it changes you.
 - Sin means going off-course. Missing the mark. Self-deception.
 - Prophet → He who wakes you up to how you are off-course.
